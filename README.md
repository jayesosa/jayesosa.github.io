The Reverberator by Jaye Sosa

The Reverberator uses a web audio API extension called Reverb.js that creates reverb nodes. An audio file, Bach's Prelude in C minor in this case, will be convolved with various examples within a impulse-response reverb library.

INSTRUCTIONS

Click play to hear Bach's Prelude in C minor played through various acoustical spaces using convolution reverb. 
Press stop to stop the audio.
Currently there isn't a feature where pressing play again after stopping can resume playback, so a page refresh is the only way.
